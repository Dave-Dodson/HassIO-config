My Hass.io configuration running on a Raspberry Pi 2.

At time of writing I have Hass.io linked with a set of Philips Hue lights, IKEA lights, my computers, a Xioami Aqara temperature sensor, motion sensors and an Amazon Echo Dot, with hopefully more soon.

I have also created a custom component to control a Heatmiser WiFi thermostat, which is a work in progress.
